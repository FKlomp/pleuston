First, list of all related git-project issues related to the frontend:
* Publisher register new asset: https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/issues/51
* Publisher set/update metadata: https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/issues/54
* Publisher flow: https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/issues/57
* Consumer flow: https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/issues/56
* GUI design: https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean/issues/58
