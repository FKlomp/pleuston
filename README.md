## Quick Start

Pleuston is a single page React app, bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To start development, first clone this repository and start up all the other Ocean Protocol components with `docker-compose`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/pleuston.git
cd pleuston/

docker-compose up
```

Then move on to a new terminal window, install all dependencies, and start the development server of `pleuston`:

```bash
npm i
npm start
````

This should output a message as follows:

```bash
Compiled successfully!

You can now view @oceanprotocol/pleuston in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000/
```

You can inspect a full production build by creating it first, and then run a local web server on top of the build output, e.g. [`serve`](https://github.com/zeit/serve).

```bash
# create production build
npm run build

serve -s build/
# go to http://localhost:5000
```

## Ocean Protocol Components

All required components to get `pleuston` running are pre-configured and started with the above `docker-compose` command, and the web app is configured to connect to them.

If you want to change and run `pleuston` against your own deployed components, head over to the [`src/config.js`](./src/config.js) file and modify the respective values.

### Keeper

After following the instructions outlined above, Pleuston will connect to the locally running RPC client under `http://localhost:8545` where all required smart contracts are deployed so you don't have to configure anything else.

The Keeper Contracts ABI's are published as a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts) and imported in the project.

### Provider

The app connects to the locally running Ocean Protocol Provider backend, exposed under `http://localhost:5000`.

### Database

Pleuston is currently using [BigchainDB](http://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb) as a database backend and is configured to automatically connect to the locally running BigchainDB node, exposed under `http://localhost:9984`.

## Code style

Code linting is setup with [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [stylelint](https://stylelint.io) following [eslint-config-oceanprotocol](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/eslint-config-oceanprotocol) and [stylelint-config-bigchaindb](https://github.com/bigchaindb/stylelint-config-bigchaindb).

There's a npm script setup which runs all linting tests:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Testing

Automatic tests are setup via Travis, executing `npm test`.

At the moment, besides linting tests, there's only one test checking if the whole app can be rendered.
